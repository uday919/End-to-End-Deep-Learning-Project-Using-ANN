## Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the complete workflow of a deep learning project, from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment. The project uses an ANN to tackle a specific machine learning task, such as image classification, text analysis, or regression.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The project includes comprehensive data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, feature engineering, and data normalization.
- **Model Training**: The project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture to train the model on the prepared dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: The project includes thorough evaluation of the trained model, such as calculating performance metrics, visualizing results, and analyzing model behavior.
- **Deployment**: The trained model is deployed on Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the application and see the model's predictions.
